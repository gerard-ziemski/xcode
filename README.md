# xcode
xcode project generator for building and running/debugging JDK VM hotspot

author: gerard.ziemski@oracle.com

Place the "xcode" folder inside openjdk "jdk" folder, "cd" into it and execute "run_clean.sh"

It will take a while to build hotspot VM first, it will then generate Xcode project in "build/xcode" folder,
which you can double click to open and use Xcode IDE to develop/debug/run java.
